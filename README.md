# Masterpieces in Data: SQL Insights from Famous Paintings & Museums

##  Project Overview
This SQL project explores a dataset containing information about famous paintings, museums, artists, canvas sizes, and more. Using complex SQL queries, I uncovered insights related to museum operations, pricing strategies, artist popularity, and geographical trends.


##  Business Questions Answered
- Which paintings are not displayed in museums?
- Are there museums without paintings?
- Which paintings are undervalued or overpriced?
- What are the most popular styles and canvas sizes?
- Which museums are open every day or for the longest hours?
- Who are the most globally recognised artists?
