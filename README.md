##  Project Overview
This SQL project explores a dataset containing information about famous paintings, museums, artists, canvas sizes, and more. Using complex SQL queries, I uncovered insights related to museum operations, pricing strategies, artist popularity, and geographical trends.

##  Business Questions Answered
- Which paintings are not displayed in museums?
- Are there museums without paintings?
- Which paintings are undervalued or overpriced?
- What are the most popular styles and canvas sizes?
- Which museums are open every day or for the longest hours?
- Who are the most globally recognised artists?

## Key Outcomes
- Revealed undervalued paintings to support pricing reevaluation
- Identified underutilised museums for potential exhibit placement
- Cleaned and validated key data tables for reliable reporting
- Ranked top artists and museums for promotional or strategic focus
- Delivered geographic insights on museum and artwork distribution
